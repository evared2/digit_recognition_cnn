MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

This project demonstrates how to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow.

üìä Results
The model achieves approximately 98% accuracy on the test set after training for 5 epochs.


üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

    TensorFlow / Keras
    Python
    NumPy, Matplotlib
    

ü§ñ Model Architecture

The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with:

    2 convolutional layers
    2 max-pooling layers
    1 fully connected (dense) layer
    10 output classes (0-9)



 How to Run the Code :
 
 1.Clone the repository:
