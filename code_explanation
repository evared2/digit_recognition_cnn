Code Explanation

This Python code trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits.
Steps:

    Import Required Libraries:

        Importing libraries such as tensorflow, numpy, matplotlib, and keras for model building, data handling, and visualization.

    Load the MNIST Dataset:

        The MNIST dataset (consisting of 28x28 grayscale images of digits) is loaded and split into training and test sets.

    Preprocessing the Data:

        Normalize the images to values between 0 and 1 for better model performance.

        Reshape the labels to one-hot encoding format, which is required for classification.

    Build the CNN Model:

        The model consists of:

            Conv2D Layers: Extract features from the images.

            MaxPooling2D Layer: Reduce the spatial dimensions of the features.

            Flatten Layer: Convert 2D features to 1D.

            Dense Layer: Fully connected layers that learn the relationships between the features.

            Output Layer: Softmax activation to output probabilities for the 10 possible digits (0-9).

    Compile the Model:

        Optimizer: Adam optimizer is used for updating the weights.

        Loss Function: Categorical cross-entropy, as this is a multi-class classification problem.

        Metric: Accuracy, to monitor the performance of the model.

    Train the Model:

        The model is trained on the training data for 5 epochs with a batch size of 64, and the performance is evaluated using the test data.

    Visualize the Results:

        Plot the training accuracy to visualize how the model improved during training.

        Show an example of predicted labels for test images, compared with the true labels.



About the dataset:


MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology)

The MNIST dataset is a large collection of handwritten digits, commonly used for training image processing systems.
Key Information:

    Content: The dataset contains 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).

    Total Images: 70,000 images in total.

        Training Set: 60,000 images.

        Test Set: 10,000 images.

    Labels: Each image is labeled with the corresponding digit (0-9).

    Format: The dataset is stored in two parts:

        Images: 28x28 pixel images.

        Labels: Integer values (0-9) representing the digit in the image.
